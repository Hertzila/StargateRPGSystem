This is system for FoundryVTT based on original sheet implementation for Roll20:
https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/Stargate-RPG

It is in super early stage and pretty much only part of visualizaiton is working as iam currently learning FoundryVTT API and stuff myself.
System should ideally contain at least characted sheet port and possibly if i have more time some prepared weapons and items.

# Latest news
Systems are going along nicely and i believe that in a week or so basic workings for sheet and weapon management will be ready to play.
I also did setup donate option if you would like to increase my motivation to make it into great system!
